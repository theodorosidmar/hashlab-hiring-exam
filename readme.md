## Running
```bash
> docker-compose up --build
```

## Discussing points
* gRPC Server running insecurely;
* Logging all services;
* Environment variables management (not hardcoded in docker-compose maybe);
* Services running on default port;
* Proto files share/management (in case of update);
* Better gRPC server request validations;
* Error handlers;
* Scalability;
* Why mongoDB?
